# quaverBot
A bot for the game quaver

Features:
- Basically can play almost any 4 key song
- Supports hold notes (little bit buggy)

Limitations:
- Can only play 4 key songs
- Can only work with circle notes and I haven't tested it with other skins

How to use:
To run this bot, you need to have python installed

You need to install the required packages for the bot which are mss, pillow and pyautogui

The command to install all of these packages is

```pip install mss Pillow pynput```

Once these packages are installed, open a terminal in the folder and run the bot with

```python3 main.py```
